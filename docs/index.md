This page will contain general information about Mob Origins.

- If you have a modded villager, you can make it drop special loot for the illager origins by putting a loot table in `moborigins/loot_tables/illager/`. The loot table name should be the ID of the villager profession.
- If another mod adds custom illagers, you can add them to the `moborigins/tags/entity_type/illagers.json` if you want them to be peaceful towards illager origins. (This may not work for all mobs)
- The same principle above also works for guardians with `moborigins/tags/entity_type/guardians.json`
