# Welcome to the UPL (Ultra Power Library) Documentation
This documentation contains information about UPL, Mob Origins, and Fantasy Origins (Unreleased at the time of writing this)

This page will contain general information about my origin addons.

- If you have a modded villager, you can make it drop special loot for the illager origins by putting a loot table in `moborigins/loot_tables/illager/`. The loot table name should be the ID of the villager profession.
- If another mod adds custom illagers, you can add them to the `moborigins/tags/entity_type/illagers.json` if you want them to be peaceful towards illager origins. (This may not work for all mobs)
- The same principle above also works for guardians with `moborigins/tags/entity_type/guardians.json`
